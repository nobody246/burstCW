# burstCW

Same idea as seen here https://cryptomuseum.com/burst/index.htm

csi bcw.scm "MSG IN CAPS" - writes over burstCW.wav with encoded CW message.

wavrx.sh #SLOWDOWN burstCWSlowed.wav given number of times and play it back

i.e, "./wavrx.sh 85" will slow burstCW.wav 85 times in burstCWSlowed.wav and then play the slowed audio back.
