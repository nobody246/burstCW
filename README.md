# burstCW

Same idea as seen here https://cryptomuseum.com/burst/index.htm

csi bcw.scm "MSG IN CAPS" - writes over burstCW.wav with encoded CW message.
rx.sh 'playback speed' - plays back burstCW.wav at, i.e, 0.1 to 0.2 are decent playback speed values to pass this script.

rx.sh works well/best with a 11025Hz sample rate for burstCW.wav
